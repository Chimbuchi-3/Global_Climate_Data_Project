GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION

PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This project analyzes publicly available climate data, specifically focusing on CO₂ emissions and temperature changes over time and across different countries. The goal is to identify trends, understand the contributions of various countries, explore correlations between climate indicators, and visualize geographical variations and potential vulnerabilities. The findings are presented in both a Colab notebook and an interactive Streamlit application.

DATA SOURCES:

The project utilizes the following datasets from Our World in Data:

CO₂ Emissions Data: Provides comprehensive data on CO₂ emissions from various sources, population, GDP, and other related indicators for numerous countries and regions over a long period.
Source: [`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/co2-data/master/owid-co2-data.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/co2-data/master/owid-co2-data.csv)
Temperature Change Data: Contains data on temperature anomalies relative to a baseline period. (Note: Due to issues with accessing the real temperature data URL during development, dummy data was used for demonstration in the notebook. The Streamlit app uses a similar dummy dataset for integration purposes).

AnNALYSIS PERFORMED

The analysis covers the following key areas:

1. Data Loading and Preparation: Loading the datasets and performing necessary cleaning and preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and converting data types.
2. Data Integration: Merging the CO₂ emissions data with temperature data based on country and year.
3. Global Trends Analysis: Visualizing global CO₂ emissions and temperature anomalies over time to identify overall trends and potential relationships. Annotations were added to highlight significant historical events and policies.
4. Country-Specific Analysis: Examining the evolution of CO₂ emissions, GDP, and population growth for selected key countries. Visualizing these trends and analyzing per capita emissions and emissions per unit of GDP.
5. Inter-Indicator Correlation: Analyzing correlations between various climate indicators such as CO₂ emissions, temperature change (using available data), population, and GDP to understand their relationships.
6. Geographical and Vulnerability Analysis: Visualizing the geographical distribution of CO₂ emissions and temperature change using choropleth maps to understand spatial patterns and discuss potential regional vulnerabilities.
7. Per Capita and Historical Contributions: Analyzing and visualizing per capita CO₂ emissions and historical cumulative CO₂ emissions to understand the historical responsibility and current impact of different countries.
8. Policy Insights and Strategies: Discussing potential policy recommendations and highlighting successful mitigation/adaptation strategies based on the insights gained from the data analysis.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

(This section would contain a summary of the key findings from the analysis, addressing the initial questions posed in the notebook. You can populate this section based on the insights gained from running the code and interpreting the visualizations and statistical outputs.)

HOW TO RUN THE NOTEBOOK

1.  Open in Google Colab: Open this notebook in Google Colab.
2.  Run Cells: Execute the code cells sequentially to load data, perform analysis, and generate visualizations.

HOW TO RUN THE STREAMLIT APPLICATION

1.  Save `app.py`: Ensure the `app.py` file is saved in your environment (this was done by a previous code cell).
2.  Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python installed and the required libraries (streamlit, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, plotly, statsmodels, requests) are installed. If not, run the following command in your terminal or a code cell in the notebook:
